# Andrew-Karpathy-gpt

Code is basically rewritten Andrew Karpathy [lecture material](https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture)
with purpose to understand how do LLMs, Transformers and GPT work. My goal here is
to train tranformer with my own dataset, that I got through scrapping
my vk.com PM's using my [JS script](https://github.com/suffermuffin/vk.com-msg-scrapper).
Dataset and aquired model's weights won't be shared.
